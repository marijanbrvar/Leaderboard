# Project Leaderboard: setup project

> In this activity I will set up a JavaScript project for the Leaderboard list app, using webpack and ES6 features, notably modules. Here I should develop a first working version of the app following a wireframe, but without styling - just focus on functionality. In following activities, I will consume the Leaderboard API using JavaScript async and await and add some styling.
